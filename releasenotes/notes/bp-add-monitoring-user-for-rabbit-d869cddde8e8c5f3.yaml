    Kolla-Ansible now supports creating a monitoring
    user for RabbitMQ.
    The monitoring user has read only access to the
    openstack vhost and is tagged with the 'monitoring'
    tag which allows it to report node-level information
    such as system resource usage. By default the
    monitoring user is disabled. To create it, the user
    should override the rabbitmq_monitoring_user variable.
